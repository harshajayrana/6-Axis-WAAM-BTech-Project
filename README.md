# 6-Axis-WAAM-BTech-Project
Bachelor Thesis Project

In this Project we analyse the Workspace of different configurations of CNC Machines and plot them in MATLAB.
Denavit Hartenberg parameters are used to make the kinematic model of the robot.
Robotic toolbox is used for the Forward and Inverse Kinematics.
The Endeffector transformation thus obtained from the Forward Kinematics, is used for plotting the Workspace.

Jacobian matrix is used to calculate the Mobility of the configuration.
Dexterity Analysis is done using Inverse Kinematics.
